# recruit-notification

A lightweight Python automation tool that monitors the internship recruitment page of the Department of Statistics at NCKU and sends alerts to a private Discord channel if new announcements are posted within the last three days.

---

## Motivation

Internship recruitment announcements (e.g., part-time survey caller openings) are often quietly updated on a static webpage. Instead of manually checking every day, this script automates the monitoring and notification process so I donâ€™t miss any time-sensitive opportunities.

---

## Deployment

This script is scheduled to run **daily** on [Render.com](https://render.com/), acting as a private notifier for job-related announcements.
